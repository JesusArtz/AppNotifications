CTRL App is a python Tkinter tool that allows you to receive alerts that remind you for example to drink water or get up from the chair
UPDATE: The app now throws notifications about curious data

# Installation
If you are using Linux or Linux 2

`pip install notify2`

If you are using Windows 10 or 11

`pip install win10toast`

# Usage

This is a beta, the operation is not correct, therefore it may fail

### Start the program

To start the program you must run the Tkinter window with
`python app.py`

Once the interface is started, click "Start"

Checkboxes are still useless

### Close the program

As it is a beta phase, the program cannot be finished from the interface yet, to do this, follow these steps

###### Windows

Go to your task manager

Look for the process called python, if you can't find it as a separate process look in the CMD or VSC threads

Select the process and click on "Finish Task"

###### Linux

To close the application in Linux, in my case Fedora, go to the system monitor, go to the Processes section and search for python
